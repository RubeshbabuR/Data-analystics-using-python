Overview:
This project involves a basic data analytics task using Python and Pandas. The dataset comprises fictional student information, including their names, ages, grades, subjects, and scores.

Dataset Description:
Columns:
Name: Student's name
Age: Student's age
Grade: Student's grade level
Subject: Subject the student is studying
Score: Student's score in the subject
Project Structure:
Files:
main.py: Contains Python code for data analysis.
README.md: Overview and instructions for running the code.
Dataset:
The dataset is represented as a CSV file or loaded directly in the Python script.
Analysis Conducted:
Average Score:
Calculated the average score of all students in the dataset.
Highest Score:
Found the highest score achieved by any student.
Lowest Score:
Determined the lowest score among all students.
Average Scores by Subject:
Grouped the data by subject and calculated the average scores for each subject.
How to Use:
Requirements:
Ensure Python and Pandas are installed.
Running the Code:
Simply execute the main.py file to perform the data analysis.
Adjust the file name or path if using an external dataset.
Understanding the Output:
Results will display the dataset, average, highest, and lowest scores, and the average scores for each subject.
Future Improvements:
This project can be extended by including visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to represent the data graphically.
Conclusion:
This simple data analytics project serves as a fundamental demonstration of using Python and Pandas for basic data analysis tasks. The code can be further developed and expanded for more complex analysis or visualization.
